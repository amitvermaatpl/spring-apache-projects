# What and Why: Apache Camel #
  > Itâ€™s a set of Java APIs that help you integrate and process data between different computer systems. 
  > Almost any time you need to move data from A to B, you can probably use Camel.
  
## Thinking in Camel ##
 > A route is a pipe that moves data from one place to another. It moves data between things called endpoints.
 > To allow Camel to connect to an endpoint, it comes with a library of components. You can also think of it like an adaptor.
 
 > Example:- COMPONENT 		PURPOSE							 ENDPOINT URI
 			 File 	 		for reading and writing files 	 file:
 			 
 > Between each endpoint, the data can also be transformed or modified, either by passing the data through another 
   endpoint, or by using an EIP.
   
   EIP name 	What it does 							Java syntax
   From* 	    Receives a message from an endpoint 	.from()
   To* 			Sends a message to an endpoint 			.to()
   
> Finally, to run and manage your routes, Camel has a container called the Camel Context.
